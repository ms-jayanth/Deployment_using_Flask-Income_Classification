# Deployment_using_Flask-Income_Classification

User Interface: https://income-predictor-from-census.herokuapp.com

The main reason for creating this repository is to know how to deploy ML model using Flask and Heroku so, I have incorporated my work on the dataset found in Kaggle.

## Problem statement:
We have been provided with an [Excel dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wenruliu/adult-income-dataset) that has 15 columns and 48842 rows. Our task is to analyze the dataset and predict whether the income of an adult will exceed 50k per year or not by developing a supervised machine learning model.

## Conclusion:
Finally! we successfully created a classification Machine Learning prediction model using decision tree classifier that predicts whether a given adultâ€™s income will be >50K or not.
